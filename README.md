# Genetic algorithm for feature selection

Feature selection is a key step during modelling to remove irrelevant and redundant variables from data. Those features may reduce the model accuracy and increase overfitting.

## Files descriptions
The genetic_step.py file contains every single steps of a genetic algorithm.
The variable_selection.py file construct the feature selection algorithm using every single steps.

In the test_ga_scripts folder, several test are created in order to understand the performances of the genetic algorithm and challenge it against other feature selection methods.

### Prerequisites
Required libraries:
Python 3.7
itertools, matplotlib, mlxtend, numpy, pandas, sklearn, time, typing
